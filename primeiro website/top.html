    <h1>General Overview</h1>
    <p>There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias,
        here are some ways of looking for information.</p>

    <dt>by Subject </dt>
    <dd> A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.</dd>

    <dt>by Type</dt>
    <dd>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: About the W3
        project.</dt>
