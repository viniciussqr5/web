    <h1>What is HyperText</h1>
    <p>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.<br>
        Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965 (see
        History).</p>
    <p>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and
        sound , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</p>
    <p>Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.</p>
